# push_swap
push_swap is a algorithm project. Data will need to be sorted and you have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

The Goal is to write 2 programs in C.

1. checker
> Checker takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard output. Once read, checker executes them and displays OK if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display KO.

2. push_swap
> Push_swap calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.

## Game Rules
Following operations are allowed to use.

| Command       | Description                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| <b>sa</b>     | swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements). |
| <b>sb</b>     | swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements). |
| <b>ss</b>     | sa and sb at the same time. |
| <b>pa</b>     | push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty. |
| <b>pb</b>     | push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty. |
| <b>ra</b>     | rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| <b>rb</b>     | rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| <b>rr</b>     | ra and rb at the same time. |
| <b>rra</b>    | reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The flast element becomes the first one. |
| <b>rrb</b>    | reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The flast element becomes the first one. |
| <b>rrr</b>    | rra and rrb at the same time. |

At the end, stack b must be empty and all integers must be in stack a, sorted in ascending order.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kefujiwa/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make all
```
This will generate checker and push_swap program.

### Usage
```bash
# generate random list of integers
ARG=`jot -r -s " " 100 -2147483648 2147483647`

# check how many moves (instructions) the push_swap program generates.
./push_swap `echo $ARG` | wc -l

# check if the instructions generated by push_swap will sort the integers in ascending order correctly.
./push_swap `echo $ARG` | ./checker $ARG

# use -v option if you want to check the stackâ€™s status after each operation.
./push_swap `echo $ARG` | ./checker -v $ARG

# use -c option if you want to color the last operation.
./push_swap `echo $ARG` | ./checker -c $ARG
```
